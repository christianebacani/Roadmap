Primeagen:	It is okay to use a totally different language from industry standard language like OCaml for web backend
Primeagen:	Why not
Primeagen:	I mean, the thing is industry standard, whatever that means, right
Primeagen:	Industry standard, does that mean Java
Primeagen:	Right, remember Go is now pretty popular, Java's pretty popular, is Rust getting popular, TypeScript has been on the decline, which is great
Primeagen:	And so it's one of those things where what is industry standard, A, but B, what is the purpose of you building a web framework
Primeagen:	or not building a web framework, but building something in the web in OCaml
Primeagen:	Is it so that you learn OCaml
Primeagen:	Yes, you're going to learn OCaml
Primeagen:	But what else are you going to get out of it
Primeagen:	You're also going to get out a distinct knowledge of how to build a website, which is completely transferable between languages
Primeagen:	Languages are just a way to express an idea, and when you have the idea understood, expressing it
Primeagen:	is much easier even if the syntax to the expression is unknown, right
Primeagen:	It creates a mode around your job because no one knows OCaml, boom, right
Primeagen:	Yes, industry standard equals DX, which equals what I like, fair
Primeagen:	But what I mean is that you learn what something means and like how to scale it, how to do things
Primeagen:	And so you don't need
Primeagen:	your side projects to always be excelling what you do in your full-time job
Primeagen:	Typically, how I think about it, I think about it like this, honestly
Primeagen:	Let's just do this for a second, because I think this is kind of important, because I see this stuff all the time
Primeagen:	Thank you, Valeni
Primeagen:	I see this all the time, which is
Primeagen:	People have this notion that what they're working on, their work, which maybe is in Go, Java, whatever, how about it's TypeScript in front end, and when they build their little side project that they get in the lesser hours of their day, however long this looks like, their fun side, they literally use TypeScript
Primeagen:	They just do front ends
Primeagen:	They use all the same stuff
Primeagen:	From here into here
Primeagen:	And I don't do that because that's not what I want to do
Primeagen:	It's because there's a future point that I think exists where I'm working on something different
Primeagen:	Future work
Primeagen:	what I want, where I want, and what I want to do is I typically try to make my future work, oh let's reverse that arrow, I make my fun side reflect where I want to be in the future
Primeagen:	For the last two years I programmed countless hours of rust for my side projects without being paid ever
Primeagen:	a single dime to write Rust
Primeagen:	I now write Rust 20 to 30% of my time at Netflix
Primeagen:	Was it worth that
Primeagen:	Absolutely
Primeagen:	I'm telling you, develop the skills of where you want to be, not the skills of what you're doing currently
Primeagen:	You will master this particular thing at your job over time
Primeagen:	This, on the other hand, is for where you take the next step
Primeagen:	And I really, really, really want to make sure people actually do that, because it's super, super important
Primeagen:	Okay
Primeagen:	Anyways, the name... ...is the Primogen
Primeagen:	Like
Primeagen:	And subscribe
Primeagen:	Why haven't you liked and subscribed
Primeagen:	This was great advice
