# Roadmap

Welcome to my Roadmap repository! This repository contains a comprehensive collection of my projects as I progress through my learning journey in data engineering. Each folder represents a specific area of study and includes various types of projects, such as mini-projects, guided projects, hobby projects, and industry projects. This roadmap showcases my development and serves as a portfolio to demonstrate my skills and growth.

## Overview

This repository is structured to reflect my learning path in data engineering. The projects within each file showcase practical applications of the concepts I have learned. By organizing my projects in this manner, I aim to provide a clear and structured overview of my skills and capabilities.

## Roadmap Files

### Understanding Data Engineering

The `Understanding Data Engineering.md` file compiles key theoretical concepts and definitions that I learned from the DataCamp "Understanding Data Engineering" course. This file serves as a reference guide for important topics and terminologies in data engineering.

### Introduction to SQL

The `Stored Procedure.sql` and `Student Tables and Views.sql` files contain projects I created while learning Introduction to SQL. These are simple mini-projects that demonstrate concepts learned during the course, focusing on:

- **Stored Procedures**: Demonstrated in the `Stored Procedure.sql` file.
- **Creating Views in SQL**: Showcased in the `Student Tables and Views.sql` file.

### Key Concepts Covered

- **Airflow**: An open-source workflow management platform used to schedule data engineering tasks.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Amazon's cloud computing services.
- **Azure**: Microsoft's cloud services.
- **Big Data**: The systematic storage, management, and analysis of datasets that are too large or complex for traditional data-processing applications. Key characteristics include volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value.
- **Cloud Computing**: The use of a network of remote servers hosted on the internet to store, manage, and process data.
- **Database Schema**: The structure that represents the logical view of the entire database, including how data is organized and the relations among them.
- **Data Catalog**: A metadata management tool used to inventory and organize data within a system.
- **Data Engineering**: The process of transforming data into a format suited for analysis.
- **Data Ingestion**: The process of obtaining and importing data for immediate use or storage in a database.
- **Data Lake**: A repository of data stored in its natural/raw format.
- **Data Pipelines**: A series of data processing steps used by data engineers to process and move data.
- **Data Processing**: The collection and manipulation of data to produce meaningful information.
- **Data Science**: The process of extracting knowledge from data.
- **Data Warehouse**: A central repository of integrated data from one or more disparate sources.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: The process of pulling data from one database to move it to another.
- **Google Cloud**: Google's cloud services.
- **Luigi**: An open-source workflow management platform used to schedule data engineering tasks.
- **NoSQL**: A database mechanism for storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data that is modeled differently than in relational databases.
- **Parallel Computing/Processing**: The simultaneous use of multiple compute resources to solve a computational problem.
- **Query**: A request for information from a database.
- **Redshift**: Amazon's data warehouse service.
- **S3**: Amazon's object storage service.
- **Scheduling**: Organizing how tasks work together by running jobs in a specific order and resolving dependencies.
- **Structured Data**: Data organized into a formatted repository, typically a database.
- **Unstructured Data**: Information that does not have a pre-defined data model or organization.
- **Semi-Structured Data**: A mix of both structured and unstructured data, often stored in JSON, XML, or YAML formats.
- **View**: Output of a stored, frequent query on the data.
