## Overview

This repository is structured to reflect my learning path in data engineering. Each project demonstrates practical applications of the concepts I have learned, organized into dedicated files for easy navigation. By showcasing these projects, I aim to provide a clear and structured overview of my technical skills and development.

## Roadmap Files

### Understanding Data Engineering

The `Understanding Data Engineering.md` file contains key theoretical concepts and definitions from the DataCamp "Understanding Data Engineering" course. It serves as a reference guide for important topics and terminologies in the field of data engineering.

#### Key Concepts Covered

- **Airflow**: Open-source workflow management for scheduling data engineering tasks.
- **AWS (Amazon Web Services)**: Amazon's cloud computing services.
- **Azure**: Microsoft's cloud services.
- **Big Data**: Management of large and complex datasets characterized by volume, variety, velocity, veracity, and value.
- **Cloud Computing**: Utilizing remote servers hosted on the internet for data management and processing.
- **Database Schema**: The logical structure of a database, including its data organization and relationships.
- **Data Engineering**: The process of designing, constructing, and managing data systems to facilitate analysis.
- **Data Ingestion**: The process of importing data into a system or database.
- **Data Lake**: A storage repository that holds large amounts of raw data.
- **Data Pipelines**: A set of processes for moving and transforming data.
- **Data Warehousing**: Centralized storage of data from multiple sources for analysis.
- **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)**: A process that extracts data from one source, transforms it, and loads it into a target system.
- **Google Cloud**: Cloud services provided by Google.
- **NoSQL**: Non-relational databases for storing structured, semi-structured, and unstructured data.
- **Parallel Processing**: The simultaneous use of multiple compute resources to process data.
- **Redshift**: Amazon's cloud data warehouse service.
- **S3**: Amazon’s cloud object storage service.

### Introduction to SQL

The files in this section (`Stored Procedure.sql`, `Student Tables and Views.sql`) include projects from my Introduction to SQL coursework, focusing on concepts like:

- **Stored Procedures**: Demonstrated in the `Stored Procedure.sql` file.
- **Creating Views**: Showcased in the `Student Tables and Views.sql` file.

### Intermediate SQL

This section contains five mini-projects and one guided project that apply various intermediate SQL concepts, including:

- **Group By**, **Order By**, **Aggregation Functions**, **Joins**, and more.

#### Notable Projects
- **Analyzing Student's Mental Health**: This guided project uses various SQL functions (`GROUP BY`, `AVG`, `COUNT`) to analyze student data.
- **Analyze International Debt's Statistics**: Focuses on using SQL to summarize and analyze debt statistics using `GROUP BY`, `SUM`, and other essential SQL functions.
- **Exploring London’s Travel Network**: A guided project that demonstrates the use of aggregation and filtering functions (`SUM`, `GROUP BY`, `LIMIT`).

### Joining Data in SQL

Projects in this section demonstrate practical applications of SQL joins, including:

- **Inner Joins**, **Left Joins**, **Right Joins**, **Full Joins**, and **Cross Joins**.

Additional projects cover **Set Theory** operations (`UNION`, `INTERSECT`, `EXCEPT`) and **Subqueries**.

### Relational Databases in SQL

These projects focus on relational database concepts, including:

- **Data Migration**: A project that demonstrates migrating data using `INSERT INTO` and `CREATE TABLE`.
- **Attribute Constraints**: Managing data integrity through constraints like `NOT NULL`, `UNIQUE`, and foreign keys.
- **Many-to-Many Relationships**: Demonstrating relational schema designs using surrogate keys and junction tables.
- **Referential Integrity**: Managing referential integrity with `ON UPDATE` and `ON DELETE` behaviors.

### Database Design

This section covers advanced database design principles, including normalization, schema design, and best practices for creating scalable data systems.

### Data Warehousing Concepts

This directory contains all the projects that I implemented/created after learning the concepts for `Data Warehousing` that is really crucial for building `Data Platforms`
that supports `Business Intelligence`, `Analytics`, `Data Science`, and `ML/AI Operations`. It is one of the important concepts that a Data Engineer should know.

### Coding Challenges using Python and SQL

This directory includes sub-folders related to `Coding Challenges using Python and SQL` in different platforms such as `LeetCode`, `SQL-Practice`, `HackerRank`, `Programiz Pro`, and `Naukri Code 360`. Diversifying my knowledge in different area such as solving problems using algorithms, data-analysis, and database management.

### Data Engineering Projects

This directory contains all the projects that I created using difference skills related to my chosen career path which is `Data Engineering`. It consist of `Web Scraping Scripts`, `ETL/ELT Pipelines`, `Batch/Stream Processing`,  `Data Analytics`, and `AI/ML Models` Projects. 

### Python CLI Projects

This directory contains Python CLI Scripts that I built during fun time and any ideas that I come up with. Featuring also what I have learned throughout my journey learning Python for Data Engineering
