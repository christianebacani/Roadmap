167,"1/ The 2018 and 2021 estimates still include the 63 barangays from North Cotabato. Meanwhile, in 2023, these are part of BARMM already. Hence, estimates for 2018 and 2021, and 2023 for Region XII are not comparable.",,,,,,
168,"2/ The 2018 and 2021 estimates exclude the 63 barangays from North Cotabato, which are now part of BARMM in 2023. Hence, estimates for 2018 and 2021, and 2023 for BARMM are not comparable.",,,,,,
