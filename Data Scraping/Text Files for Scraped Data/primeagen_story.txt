Primeagen:	So I want to take a little bit of time and tell you kind of my story
Primeagen:	I know that there's a lot of engineers out there, a lot of people going into engineering right now for computers for, you know, computer science, making sweet science to computers
Primeagen:	And, you know, you're doing react, you're doing JavaScript, you feel defeated, you're like, well, maybe I'm not smart enough, maybe I'm not good enough if only I would have started earlier, right
Primeagen:	You know the excuses, you know the things that kind of fill you up
Primeagen:	And so I wanted to take a moment and give you my story
Primeagen:	Now, I think the most important part of my story is when I was four years old, I saw porn for the first time and from every day up pretty much until this day of my life now, I have thought about porn
Primeagen:	It's just been something that's been with me my entire life from that moment
Primeagen:	It has really robbed me of a lot of things in my life
Primeagen:	After that, the next most important thing that you just kind of have to know is my dad died when I was seven, so I didn't have a lot of, you know, I didn't have a lot of parental figure in my life for a lot of my years
Primeagen:	My mom did the best she could, but she had three kids and she was working like 80 hours a week
Primeagen:	She is a saint, a boss, she's amazing
Primeagen:	I absolutely love my mom and I have zero problems with how she raised me
Primeagen:	But the reality is, is that most of the time I was raising myself
Primeagen:	which means I never learned how to like take things really seriously
Primeagen:	So that's why by the time I graduated high school, I graduated with the 2.16
Primeagen:	Okay, it was not top of the, you know, student chart
Primeagen:	I was pretty much dead in the middle and one of the teachers I had told me I was the worst student she's ever had
Primeagen:	So, you know, wasn't the best
Primeagen:	But at the end of high schools where everything really started to go downhill
Primeagen:	Now I had a girlfriend during that time and it was kind of like a longer relationship and ultimately it didn't work out, surprise, surprise, and I just felt like I put all my identity and worth into it and so of course I tried to commit suicide during that time and I just felt this huge deep hole inside of me which ultimately led to me just stopping all forms of care for my life
Primeagen:	And so from there on out, I just did as much drugs as I could
Primeagen:	Of course, the whole porn thing was every single day
Primeagen:	I was very addicted to that
Primeagen:	I just didn't realize I was addicted to that
Primeagen:	And then of course, it went from smoking pot, mushrooms, LSD, cocaine, all the way up to methanphetamines, did meth quite a few times
Primeagen:	But for whatever reason I just had this desire or this
Primeagen:	I don't know what it was this calling destiny telling me I had to go to college and so my grandfather caused my dad dying when I was seven said he would pay for my college and low and behold Montana State University accepted being to go to college
Primeagen:	so I went
Primeagen:	And of course, I always was really fast at typing, I loved playing video games, so I figured computers, I could make video games, right
Primeagen:	Don't we all think that at some point
Primeagen:	And when I go to school, I did nothing but party
Primeagen:	I drank, I smoked, more coconut, too much LSD to the point where I had problems with my vision for years
Primeagen:	And of course, that led to me dropping out and being done with school
Primeagen:	But
Primeagen:	I still had all this unhappiness, and I don't know how to say it other than just despair in my life still at this point
Primeagen:	And so I did go back to school in the spring, and I actually ended up completing that, but during that time I just had this extremely real encounter with God to the point where I could see myself standing on a fork effectively
Primeagen:	where it's like on one side, I keep going down the path I'm going
Primeagen:	And it's just like there's more of what I already have
Primeagen:	I'm unhappy
Primeagen:	I just hate my life or I can try something different
Primeagen:	And I really did try this something different
Primeagen:	I said, okay, I'm gonna, I don't know what this means
Primeagen:	I guess I'm following God now
Primeagen:	And after that point, nothing changed
Primeagen:	I was still just as addicted to porn
Primeagen:	I still just did drugs
Primeagen:	I even, in fact, I did LSD after I did that
Primeagen:	But something happened in my heart
Primeagen:	It's where every time I did anything, I felt like a conscious, right
Primeagen:	It's like the thing that wasn't there for all these years woke up inside of me
Primeagen:	And all of a sudden, I just knew I was not made to do that
Primeagen:	And so this led me down a completely different path
Primeagen:	I actually passed school
Primeagen:	Sure, it was like season B's, but I still passed it
Primeagen:	It was the first time I ever really passed anything
Primeagen:	And of course, you know, we go through the summer
Primeagen:	I go the next year and I kind of fall back in line with my old friends
Primeagen:	And so I intentionally drop out at that point
Primeagen:	I just say, you know what
Primeagen:	I cannot do college
Primeagen:	I'm going to go down the wrong road here
Primeagen:	At that point, I was still really struggling with pornography
Primeagen:	That was by far the hardest, still smoking cigarettes, really finding that difficult to stop
Primeagen:	The drugs part, it was easier as more just like avoid the people, but cigarettes and porn were very, very hard because you don't have, you, you can avoid people and still do those
Primeagen:	So of course, in the spring time, I went to just like a local school
Primeagen:	I just, I felt so defeated
Primeagen:	I felt like I had no idea what I was doing
Primeagen:	I thought I might join seminary at that point
Primeagen:	I didn't even know what I was doing
Primeagen:	I was just like, I don't even know who I am anymore
Primeagen:	So I do a little local programming class, some math, just some core stuff to get out of the way
Primeagen:	Hated it
Primeagen:	Hated it
Primeagen:	And then I went to summer school, but I went up back to Montana State University
Primeagen:	And something happened during this time
Primeagen:	I did calculus one
Primeagen:	You wouldn't know this from the story I've been telling so far, but I failed pre-calculus twice and barely passed the third time
Primeagen:	So Calc won, I'm like, there's no way
Primeagen:	I'm probably not that smart to be able to do these things
Primeagen:	And so every single day, after three hours of calculus class, which was five days a week, I'd go to the math learning center, which was available four days a week, and be in there for one to three hours with the tutors
Primeagen:	And by the third week, I was cruising
Primeagen:	I was covered from head to toe in coconut oil
Primeagen:	I was the number one person in the class
Primeagen:	Something clicked inside of me
Primeagen:	And what it really was was the realization, yes, smarts will get you far, but hard work will get you further any day of the week
Primeagen:	And I was just murdering it
Primeagen:	By the end, we had a final and it was a two hour long test
Primeagen:	I did it in less than 30 minutes and was the highest grade in the class
Primeagen:	It's just like something happened
Primeagen:	I was changed and I started to love school
Primeagen:	I started to build this passion for learning, for wanting to pursue excellence
Primeagen:	And it just kept happening
Primeagen:	Every class I took, I kept being one of the best or the best at it every single time
Primeagen:	But still during all of this, I was struggling with porn and cigarettes and it's just like I couldn't break these addictions and it was just eating me up on the inside
Primeagen:	I hated it
Primeagen:	Then after probably my 5,000th time quitting pornography for whatever reason, it just clicked, it stayed
Primeagen:	It was, you know, my head and my heart finally made a connection and it just left me
Primeagen:	Along with smoking, it was like I was finally free of these chains
Primeagen:	It was amazing
Primeagen:	And from there, I just really have felt unstoppable in the sense that I can learn anything
Primeagen:	I have proven to myself I can do it
Primeagen:	I liked what I was doing
Primeagen:	I liked programming
Primeagen:	And so I just went nuts over it
Primeagen:	I tried to start my own company
Primeagen:	I was working like 80 hours a week
Primeagen:	My wife and I didn't have a very good relationship at that point because I was working way too hard
Primeagen:	I really wish I could have done things probably a little less enthusiastic at that point
Primeagen:	You know, fostered a better relationship would have been a smarter move
Primeagen:	I got rejected from Google, I got rejected from local companies, I got rejected actually a few times
Primeagen:	Went from the top of the top to the bottom pretty quick, but I ended up getting a job at a local place, and I hated it
Primeagen:	Again, it's just like, man, I'm so bored, I'm dying here
Primeagen:	And finally, when I just made the commitment in my heart, I'm going to be happy in this situation
Primeagen:	I'm going to find joy regardless of how entertaining my job is about how much I like doing it
Primeagen:	I am going to have joy
Primeagen:	I don't need to be happy because of my job
Primeagen:	I kid you not
Primeagen:	I made that decision on my way to my job that day
Primeagen:	And as I was getting coffee, someone from a building next door went, hey, you program right now is like, yeah, I am a programmer over at Schedulacy
Primeagen:	And it's just like, hey, you want to come work over here
Primeagen:	I'll give you 50% more money
Primeagen:	I was like, yeah, yes, yes, yes, I do
Primeagen:	And I did it
Primeagen:	It was hard
Primeagen:	It was awful, but it was amazing all at the same time
Primeagen:	It really, really helped up level me a significant amount
Primeagen:	And yes, it did strain my wife and I's relationship
Primeagen:	Yes, I probably should have said no more often, but it was also really, really good long term for my career, which is a hard balance to have
Primeagen:	And I really didn't have a good way of saying no at that point
Primeagen:	But during all of that, I got to go to a conference where I learned about RXJS
Primeagen:	I know just laugh about it, go ahead, laugh about it, right
Primeagen:	RXJS, right
Primeagen:	Anyhow, I put that on my resume that I knew it
Primeagen:	and I started learning and playing with it and guess what happened
Primeagen:	Netflix was looking for people that knew RXJS
Primeagen:	and they saw that I did it
Primeagen:	and they offered me an interview
Primeagen:	and then I got the job and for me again that shows that hard work with a little bit of luck preparation with timing and boom I got a great job
Primeagen:	and I've been there for the last
Primeagen:	you know, eight, nine years
Primeagen:	You know, I failed a lot during that intro part of my story
Primeagen:	I failed a lot
Primeagen:	It took years upon years
Primeagen:	There was no magic bullet
Primeagen:	There was no one night things went from bad to good
Primeagen:	It was a decision I made every single moment
Primeagen:	It was a decision I had to make every single day, multiple times a day to do it right
Primeagen:	And during this time of the year, this is by the way, Christmas season 2022
Primeagen:	There's this whole idea of New Year's resolutions and I've always hated them because there's not just some point in time, some new turning of the wheel in which all the sudden you have the ability to be somebody different
Primeagen:	No, make your resolution a daily resolution, a minute resolution if you have to say no a thousand times, ten thousand times
Primeagen:	you have to pursue the change you want to be
Primeagen:	And there's going to be a ton of really hard moments
Primeagen:	And I know there's a plenty of people right now in this moment who are just learning how to program and they feel defeated
Primeagen:	You feel like you're not quite learning it or maybe you're a junior engineer and you're hating your job
Primeagen:	Trust me, keep building those skills, pursue the things that are good and valuable and give it time, time, time, time
Primeagen:	It just takes a little bit of time
Primeagen:	It took me about six years
Primeagen:	You're probably smarter than me
Primeagen:	Honestly, you'll probably take you way shorter, but nonetheless, don't give up quickly
Primeagen:	Keep pursuing, keep pushing in
Primeagen:	Now, there's lots of parts of my story I didn't tell
Primeagen:	I tried to smooth over the bits, but I just wanted to be kind of honest about the higher points, which is just like, you know, I didn't have a great childhood
Primeagen:	I didn't have a great many things in my life, but I still did something with it, and I want you to be able to do it too
Primeagen:	Hey, I hope you like this story
Primeagen:	Hey, hit the like button hit the sub button mean a lot to me and I just been loving building this channel
Primeagen:	So appreciate you all genuinely
Primeagen:	Thank you
